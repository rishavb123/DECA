    % \begin{theorem}
    %     If the functions $p$ and $g$ are continuous on an open interval $I:\alpha < t < \beta$ containing the point $t = t_0$, then there exists a unique function $y = \phi(t)$ that satisfies the differential equation
    %     \begin{equation*}
    %         y' + p(t)y = g(t)
    %     \end{equation*}
