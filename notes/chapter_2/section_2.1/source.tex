\section{Linear Equations; Method of Integrating Factors}
    A \textbf{first order linear equation} is an equation that is only linearly dependent on $y$. Its general form is
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{dy}{dt} + p(t)y = g(t) \text{ or } P(t)\frac{dy}{dt} + Q(t)y = G(t)
    \end{equation*}
