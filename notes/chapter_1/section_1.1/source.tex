\section{Some Basic Mathematical Models; Directional Fields}
    Equations containing derivatives are \textbf{differential equations}. 
    \newline
    A differential equation that describes some physical process is a \textbf{mathematical model} of the process.
    \newline
    \textbf{Direction Fields} are valuable tools in studying the solutions of differential equations of the form
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} = f(t, y)
    \end{equation*}
    where $f$ is a given function of the two variables $t$ and $y$, sometimes called the \textbf{rate function}.
